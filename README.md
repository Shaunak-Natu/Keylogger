# keyboard Event Logger.

## What is a Key Logger?

A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that records every keystroke made on a computer keyboard. It is
designed to run in the background of a computer system without being detected by the user, and it can capture all the data
that is entered on the keyboard, including usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other sensitive information.

## Why is it used?

Keyloggers can be used for both legitimate and illegitimate purposes. For example, some companies use keyloggers to 
monitor employee activity on company-owned computers, while hackers may use keyloggers to steal sensitive information for
financial gain or other malicious purposes.
